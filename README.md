Multi-factor Models of Asset or Portfolio Returns

Regression-based factor models are used to forecast the expected return and the risk of a portfolio. The expected return on each asset in the portfolio is approximated as a weighted sum of the expected returns to several market risk factors. The weights are called factor sensitivities or, more specifically, factor betas and are estimated by regression. If the portfolio includes broad market indices, industry factors, style factors (e.g., value, growth, momentum, size), economic factors (e.g., interest rates, inflation) or statistical factors (e.g., principal components). By inputting scenarios and stress tests on the expected returns and the volatilities and correlations of these risk factors, the factor model representation allows the portfolio manager to examine expected returns under different market scenarios.
